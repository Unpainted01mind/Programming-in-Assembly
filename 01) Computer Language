# Computer Language

*A language is a way of communication , hence a set of words which enable the computer to read and perform instructions are known as a 
programming/computer language. We need programming languages to communicate with the computer.*

### Types of programming languages :-
*There are two types of programming languages :-*
1) Low level languages such as Assembly , Machine language.
2) High level languages such as Java , C++ , Python etc.

### Machine Language :-

*Machine language contains binary code , our computer understands only binary instructions hence machine language is the native language 
of the computer. It has a very fast processing time as it is native to the computer architecture and hence is faster than high level programming 
languages.*

### High Level Language :-

*A high level language has code writting in an English like syntax , a syntax means a basic skeleton/structure for writing a programming language.*

### Differences between High and Low Level Languages :-

* high level languages are written in simple English / syntax
* low level languages are mostly written in binary code or mnemonics like Assembly language
* high level languages are closer to humans and low level languages are closer to the computer
* hence as a result low level languages have faster processing time as compared to high level languages
