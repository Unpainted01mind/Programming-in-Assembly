# Assembly Language :-

### What is Assembly :-

*Assembly is a low level language which is designed for a specific processor , X-86 in this case.
It is one step higher than machine language which is the closest to the computer hardware. We use symbols (Mnemonics) instead of machine code
in Assembly hence it is also known as a symbolic language . For example, ADD instruction is used to add two numbers.*

### How does it work :-

*Assembly language is used so that the compiler understands the specified instructions and via an assembler converts our assembly code into machine code executable , assembly language also depends on the type of system architecture.*

### Why we study Assembly :-

* to understand hardware and software level interactions
* it gives us full control over what tasks our computer uses for processing instructions
* it enables us to understand the processor's working with memory
* to optimise the processing time
* enables one to write code and learn how to access registers and retrive the memory addresses of pointers and values in memory
