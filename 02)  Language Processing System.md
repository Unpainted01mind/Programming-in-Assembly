### 1. **Source Code**

This is the high-level code written by the programmer in a language like Python, C, Java, etc. It's human-readable and contains the logic of the program. Example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!");
    return 0;
}
```

### 2. **Interpreter**

* The **interpreter** (or sometimes just an "interpreter phase") is used in languages like Python, Ruby, etc., to directly execute the high-level code line-by-line.
* However, in compiled languages (like C, C++), the code typically doesn't go through an interpreter at this stage.
* For compiled languages, this step might be skipped or replaced by pre-compilation tools. But the interpreter can help developers during debugging by showing immediate results or errors.

### 3. **Modified Source Code**

* During development, source code may be modified to fix bugs or improve the program’s logic. This step involves editing the source code and saving it in the correct format.

### 4. **Compiler**

* The **compiler** translates the high-level source code into a lower-level intermediate representation. In languages like C, the compiler turns the source code into **assembly code** (which is still human-readable but much closer to machine language). The compiler may also optimize the code for performance.
* This phase checks for syntax errors and, if none are found, generates the assembly code.

Example:
The C compiler might convert the C code into assembly like:

```assembly
; Assembly code example (x86 architecture)
section .data
    msg db 'Hello, World!', 0
section .text
    global _start
_start:
    ; code to print the message
```

### 5. **Target Assembly Code**

* The **target assembly code** is a low-level representation of the program. It’s still human-readable but much closer to the machine code specific to a particular processor architecture (e.g., x86, ARM).
* This assembly code is written using mnemonics for instructions that are understood by the CPU.

### 6. **Assembler**

* The **assembler** takes the target assembly code and translates it into **machine code** (binary code) that a CPU can understand.
* The assembler converts the mnemonics and labels in the assembly code to specific binary instructions for a given architecture.
* After this, the program is no longer in a human-readable format; it's in binary form (though still in a form like **relocatable object code**).

Example:
The assembler might convert an instruction like `MOV AX, 1` into the machine code `B8 01 00 00 00`.

### 7. **Relocatable Machine Code**

* The **relocatable machine code** is essentially machine code that can be loaded into memory at different addresses. It's not yet fully ready to execute because it may contain references to functions or variables that need to be "linked" together.
* At this stage, the code is usually stored in object files (with extensions like `.obj` or `.o`).

### 8. **Linker/Loader**

* The **linker** is responsible for combining one or more object files into a **single executable**. It resolves references between modules (e.g., functions or variables in different object files) and ensures everything is in the correct memory address.

* If the program uses external libraries (like math functions from a math library), the linker will also link these external libraries or object files into the executable.

* The **loader** loads the final executable into memory to prepare it for execution.

* The result of the linking process is usually a **fully relocatable executable** (with extensions like `.exe`, `.out`, etc.) that can be run directly.

### 9. **Target Machine Code**

* The **target machine code** is the final binary form of the program. It’s specific to the architecture of the machine it was compiled for (e.g., x86, ARM).
* This is the code the operating system and CPU can execute directly.

### 10. **Execution**

* Finally, when the program is executed, the operating system loads the machine code into memory, and the CPU runs the program’s instructions step-by-step.
* During execution, the program may interact with the OS, hardware, or external libraries to perform its tasks.
